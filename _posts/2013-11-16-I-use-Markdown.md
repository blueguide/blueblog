Markdown
========

A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

### Header 3

> This *is a blockquote*.
> 
> This _is the second paragraph_ in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 __in a blockquote__

* Candy.
* Gum.
* Booze.

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue

*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

*   Another item in the list.

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

    <blockquote>
        <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>

Use the `printf()` function.
